# ComputerControllerAI
THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROGRAM ONLY RUN IN INSTANCED WINDOWS MACHINES

This application utilizes ChatGPT vision plus GridGPT to let ChatGPT vision control your computer.

This application is extremely dangerous do not run it on your local computer, depending on the personality you give the AI it could do some terrible things like delete your entire c drive, however this is vastly mitigated by OpenAI making ChatGPT the most friendly AI in existence. Make sure you have no identifiable information on the pc where you run this. 

The main premise is - what if we got Chatgpt to roleplay as a human with a personality you setup.  Then give it access to windows 11 and allow it to do anything it wants. Well it can do a lot of stuff apparently...
